    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is John Paul
\n\nI love Jollof Rice
\n\nThe kind that is prepared in big party pot with the burnt flavour haha
\nFun fact is that I love Tom Clancy novels especially the Sum of all fears... wonderful thriller
\n\nI like Suits; Harvey Specter, Mike Ross, Jessica Pearson, Donna Paulsen and Rachel Zane are my favs
\nAnd sometimes I even watch Silicon Valley
\nAnd even less sometimes I make plans
\n\nOnce upon a time, I was browsing through twitter, I searched for a man and I sent him because I found his work on medical imaging interesting
\n\nI'll happy to show you around Ibadan if you come visiting.
\nYou should watch Suits, it's a good show.\n\n    </string>
